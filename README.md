# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in C++.

## Problems Solved

1. **Min Difference After Removal of Elements**  
   - Problem: Find the minimum difference after removing a specified number of elements from an array.

2. **Find Subsequence of Length K with Largest Sum**  
   - Problem: Find the subsequence of length k with the largest sum from a given list.

3. **Largest Sum After K Negations**  
   - Problem: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, choose indices and replace `nums[i]` with `-nums[i]` exactly `k` times to get the largest possible sum of the array.

4. **Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits**  
   - Problem: Given an integer array `arr`, sort the integers in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation. If two integers have the same number of 1's, sort them in ascending order by value.

5. **Product of Array Except Self**  
   - Problem: Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`. Solve it in O(n) time without using division.
